# Machine-Learning-Projects
Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.<br>
<br>
In this repository, I have listed all the projects that I have done in the field of Machine Learning.<br>

1) [Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/shivi0/Linear-Regression-Project)
2) [Logistic Regression Project](https://github.com/shivi0/Logistic-Regression-Project)
3) [KNN Project](https://github.com/shivi0/KNN-Project)
4) [Decision Tree and Random Forest](https://github.com/shivi0/Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest-Project)
